title: New Control Syntax
---

**Note** The syntax described in this section is currently under revision.
[Here is the new version which will be implemented in Dotty 0.20](./control-syntax-new.html).

Scala 3 has a new "quiet" syntax for control expressions that does not rely in
enclosing the condition in parentheses, and also allows to drop parentheses or braces
around the generators of a `for`-expression. Examples:
```scala
if x < 0 then -x else x

while x >= 0 do x = f(x)

for x <- xs if x > 0
yield x * x

for
  x <- xs
  y <- ys
do
  println(x + y)
```

The rules in detail are:

 - The condition of an `if`-expression can be written without enclosing parentheses if it is followed by a `then`.
 - The condition of a `while`-loop can be written without enclosing parentheses if it is followed by a `do`.
 - The enumerators of a `for`-expression can be written without enclosing parentheses or braces if they are followed by a `yield` or `do`.
 - A `do` in a `for`-expression expresses a `for`-loop.
 - Newline characters are not statement separators in a condition of an `if` or a `while`.
   So the meaning of newlines is the same no matter whether parentheses are present
   or absent.
 - Newline characters are potential statement separators in the enumerators of a `for`-expression.

### Rewrites

The Dotty compiler can rewrite source code from old syntax and new syntax and back.
When invoked with options `-rewrite -new-syntax` it will rewrite from old to new syntax, dropping parentheses and braces in conditions and enumerators. When invoked with with options `-rewrite -old-syntax` it will rewrite in the reverse direction, inserting parentheses and braces as needed.
